  Hello! Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹. 
  I'm AndrÃ©s, a software and web developer from Lugo, Spain. 
</center></h2>

I am currently working as a Python Developer at [Gompute](https://www.gompute.com)

I like to create code and audiovisual stuff in general so I'll be posting contributions around here
from time to time. My main focus is Java, Python, JavaScript and specially with the Vue framework.
I also like music, I've made a little bit myself, and also audiovisual projects with programs like
Photoshop, After Effects, Lightroom, Sony Vegas etc.
In the 3D side I've also worked with Blender while at Gompute.
I always like to learn new things from people so don't doubt in contact me for any
projects!

A couple of things about me: 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Gompute, an HPC swedish company
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Docker and want to learn the Java Spring framework
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects, specially related to music and automotive things. Code is for everything!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any doubt you can have, I may have the answer or learn myself so it's always a good experience!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sdreworks@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Spain, but not the sunny one you can imagine!
