  Hello! Welcome to my Github. 
  I'm AndrÃ©s, a software and web developer from Lugo, Spain. 
</center></h2>

I like to create code and audiovisual stuff in general so I'll be posting contributions around here
from time to time. <strong>My known languages are Java, PHP, Python and JavaScript, specially with the Vue framework.</strong> But <strong>my main focus is to deliver value and strive for excellence when developing software</strong>, using best practices and sharing knowledge with others.

I also like music, I've made a little bit myself, and also audiovisual projects with programs like
Photoshop, After Effects, Lightroom, Sony Vegas etc.
In the 3D side I've also worked with Blender while at Gompute, an HPC swedish company.
I always like to learn new things from people so don't doubt to contact me for any
projects!

A couple of things about me: 
- ðŸ”­ Right now I am working at [Codurance](https://www.codurance.com/), a TDD driven company.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning TDD!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects, specially related to music and automotive things. Code is for everything!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any doubt you may have, I might have the answer or learn myself so it's always a good experience.
