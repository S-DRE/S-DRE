  Hello! Welcome to my Github ðŸ‘‹. 
  I'm AndrÃ©s, a software and web developer from Lugo, Spain. 
</center></h2>

I am currently actively searching for a job, so feel free to contact me!

I like to create code and audiovisual stuff in general so I'll be posting contributions around here
from time to time. <strong>My main focus is Java, Python and JavaScript, specially with the Vue framework.</strong>

I also like music, I've made a little bit myself, and also audiovisual projects with programs like
Photoshop, After Effects, Lightroom, Sony Vegas etc.
In the 3D side I've also worked with Blender while at Gompute.
I always like to learn new things from people so don't doubt to contact me for any
projects!

A couple of things about me: 
- ðŸ”­ I've worked in Gompute, an HPC swedish company, but right now I am looking for a job
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Django!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects, specially related to music and automotive things. Code is for everything!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any doubt you can have, I may have the answer or learn myself so it's always a good experience!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sdreworks@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm from Spain, but not the sunny one you can imagine!
